############################################
# Data fixes since ChEMBL_24:
############################################

Updated ChEMBL_24 to correct a standardisation error, which resulted in a number of anti-logged measurements types having incorrect standard_type and standard_units assigned in the activities table.

############################################
# Data changes since ChEMBL_23:
############################################

# Deposited Data Sets:

K4DD Project - K4DD drug target binding kinetics data (src_id = 30, DOI = 10.6019/CHEMBL3885741)
The K4DD (Kinetics for Drug Discovery) project (started in 2012) is supported by the Innovative Medicines Initiative Joint Undertaking (IMI JU), resources of which are composed of a financial contribution from the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007-2013) and EFPIA companies' in kind contribution. Its goal is to enable the adoption of drug-target binding kinetics analysis in the drug discovery decision-making process, and thereby contribute to the development of a new generation of improved medicinal products. This data set contains drug-target binding kinetics measured for several hundred compounds using different methods such as SPR, radioligand binding and KPCA and is is provided as an open resource for future research.

MMV Pathogen Box - The Australian National University Dept Of Immunology (src_id = 34, DOI = 10.6019/CHEMBL3987221)
400 compounds from the Pathogen box were screened for inhibitory active of 2 NTD relevant human targets Ferrochelatase and  Porphobilinogen deaminase.  Chemical structures and associated data are hereby made public to encourage additional drug lead identification efforts and further research into this disease.

Published Kinase Inhibitor Set 2 - Northwick Park Institute for Medical Research (src_id = 43)(10.6019/CHEMBL3988181)
The GKS PKIS2 collection of 490 compounds were tested against Onchocerca lienalis microfilariae in a 96-well format. The assay is described in Townson et al. (2007) Challenges in drug discovery for novel antifilarials, Expert Opinion on Drug Discovery, 2, S63-S73

University of Dundee, Gates Library - Leishmania donovani Methionine tRNA synthetase screening (src_id = 33, DOI = 10.6019/CHEMBL3988442)


# Change in data deposition model:

A new data submission format and database loader has been implemented. This includes the addition of depositor-supplied IDs to the DOCS (RIDX), COMPOUND_RECORDS (CIDX) and ASSAYS (AIDX) tables, and SRC_ID information to the DOCS and ACTIVITIES table. The new deposition system allows more advanced functionality including the ability to update previously deposited data sets, and the ability to deposit activity data against existing ChEMBL compound or assay collections. This means that in future releases, it will be possible for the SRC_ID for data in the ACTIVITIES table to be different from the SRC_ID in the COMPOUND_RECORDS and/or ASSAYS tables to which the measurements relate. This has not previously been the case. For data depositors, we will release more information about the new submission format soon and hope to provide a submission portal in the future. If you wish to submit data to ChEMBL, please contact us and we will provide more details.


# Withdrawn Class information

Withdrawn drugs in ChEMBL (src_id = 36) have been annotated with a controlled vocabulary to describe the reasons for their withdrawal. This WITHDRAWN_CLASS field has been added to the MOLECULE_DICTIONARY table, molecule web service and the Compound Report Card and Browse Drugs views in the ChEMBL interface, and complements the existing (free text) WITHDRAWN_REASON field. Some drugs may have more than one term in WITHDRAWN_CLASS (represented as a semi-colon separated list). 

Current classes are:
Carcinogenicity
Cardiotoxicity
Dermatological toxicity
Gastrotoxicity
Hematological toxicity
Hepatotoxicity
Immune system toxicity
Metabolism toxicity
Misuse
Musculoskeletal toxicity
Nephrotoxicity
Neurotoxicity
Opthalmic toxicity
Psychiatric toxicity
Respiratory toxicity
Teratogenicity
Vascular toxicity


# Activity properties, supplementary data and reformatting of DrugMatrix, Open TG-GATEs and Drug Pharmacokinetic Data sets

Previously in ChEMBL parameters such as compound doses or time points could not be recorded against individual activity measurements (only the whole assay) and such experiments were typically split so that a separate assay was created for each compound or time point measured. We have now added an ACTIVITY_PROPERTIES table to the database, to allow such parameters to be captured for individual activity measurements. The table can also be used to record key experimental measurements that are important in interpreting the values reported in the ACTIVITIES table (e.g., HILL_SLOPE for a dose-response curve). Measured result types can be distinguished from experimental parameters by setting the RESULT_FLAG field = 1. Information from the ACTIVITY_PROPERTIES table can now be viewed on the Bioactivity Summary view in ChEMBL, by selecting the additional columns (see 'Interface changes' below).

The ACTIVITY_SUPP table has also been introduced to allow supplementary data for an activity measurement to be captured. For example, for in vivo toxicology data, the ACTIVITIES table may capture summary level data across a group of animals, while the ACTIVITY_SUPP table contains individual animal-level data. Similarly, where an IC50 measurement is recorded in the ACTIVITIES table, the individual % inhibition measurements (points on the curve) could be captured in ACTIVITY_SUPP. In general, such data should only be included in ChEMBL where there is a compelling need to do so (e.g., it contributes to interpreting the summary-level data), since the aim of ChEMBL is not to store raw screening data.

The existing ASSAY_PARAMETERS table has also been reformatted to allow better storage of numeric parameters (e.g., associating values and their units) and data standardisation. The ACTIVITIES, ASSAY_PARAMETERS, ACTIVITY_PROPERTIES and ACTIVITY_SUPP tables now all follow the same general format, with a set of TYPE/RELATION/VALUE/UNITS/TEXT_VALUE columns and equivalent STANDARD_TYPE/STANDARD_RELATION/STANDARD_VALUE/STANDARD_UNITS/STANDARD_TEXT_VALUE columns, storing the standardised version of the measurements. 

Due to the inclusion of the new ACTIVITY_PROPERTIES and ACTIVITY_SUPP tables in ChEMBL, a number of datasets (Open TG-GATEs, DrugMatrix in vivo data and Curated Drug Pharmacokinetic Data) have now been collapsed to a much smaller number of assays (see below). Experimental variables that were previously included in assay descriptions and as ASSAY_PARAMETERS have, in many cases, been moved to the ACTIVITY_PROPERTIES table. For Open TG-GATEs and DrugMatrix in vivo data sets, additional information has also been captured in the ACTIVITY_SUPP table. Please note, DrugMatrix in vitro pharmacology data (Document CHEMBL1909046) is unaffected by these changes.

# Removal of Tox21 assays from PubChem BioAssay set:

Assays in the PubChem BioAssay subset of ChEMBL (src_id = 7) that derive from Tox21 have been removed. This is because coverage of these assays in ChEMBL was incomplete. We are planning to replace this data with the full Tox21 data set in the near future.


# Change of InChI version

The version of Standard InChI used in ChEMBL has been upgraded from 1.02b to 1.05. As a result a small number of Standard InChIs for compounds have changed. Please note, CHEMBL_IDs and molfiles have not been altered for these compounds, only the STANDARD_INCHI and STANDARD_INCHI_KEY fields in the COMPOUND_STRUCTURES table.

# Compound Properties now calculated with RDKit

We are now using RDKit to calculate the following fields in the COMPOUND_PROPERTIES table:

MW_FREEBASE
ALOGP
HBA
HBD
PSA
RTB
QED_WEIGHTED
FULL_MWT
AROMATIC_RINGS
HEAVY_ATOMS
MW_MONOISOTOPIC
FULL_MOLFORMULA
HBA_LIPINSKI
HBD_LIPINSKI

The following derived properties are therefore also based on RDKit-calculated properties:

RO3_PASS
NUM_RO5_VIOLATIONS
NUM_LIPINSKI_RO5_VIOLATIONS

The above properties have all been recalculated for existing compounds. As a result, some properties will have changed from those in previous releases. The following properties are still calculated with ACDLabs software as before:

ACD_MOST_APKA
ACD_MOST_BPKA
ACD_LOGP
ACD_LOGD
MOLECULAR_SPECIES
